2020-04-11,#The government have stockpiled loads of bombs and missiles for war but don't have enough PPE for medical staffs forget about anyone else. Govt needs donations to fight Coronavirus but keep on spending on weapons and useless statue and self-promotion. #PehleHealthcare,Bihar,anger
2020-04-11,Poorly geared healthcare staff at government hospitals are risking their lives in the fight against the coronavirus! Healthcare sector needs funds  not claps. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,disgust
2020-04-11,Govt has made a deliberate shift from public healthcare and propped up the private healthcare industry and private health insurance. Result is a public health sector that is coming undone now that an unprecedented challenge of Coronavirus has suddenly surfaced. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,disgust
2020-04-11,India has one of the widest disparities in healthcare access and quality between the rich and poor! Coronavirus doesn't discriminate  but health care system in India does. What is the govt doing to correct this? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,sadness

2020-04-11,@rahulkanwal when are you planning to do an investigation against your bosses in the govt for not doing enough testing of COVID19? Is your spine straight? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,neutral
2020-04-11,Even earlier  we had hunger related deaths. Things have gotten worse since lockdown. Malnourished bodies are less immune to disease  including #COVID19. We can't fight against COVID19 without also fighting against hunger. #PehleHealthCare #भूख_मिटाओ_कोरोना_भगाओ,Bihar,disgust
2020-04-11,NaMo's legacy in public health as Gujarat CM Gujarat spent 4.39% of state expend on health in 1999. By 2009 this came down to 0.77%. Result: Lack of hospital beds  ventillators & ICUs. Consequence: Highest fatality rate in COVID19. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,sadness
2020-04-11,Gujarat has seen the highest fatality rate amongst COVID19 affected patients (7.88% as opposed to 2.87% for India as a whole). The public health system of Gujarat which is lying in shambles is one of the main reasons behind this. Please #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,sadness
2020-04-11,The pandemic has revealed the inadequacies of a privatized healthcare system in dealing with crisis. The biggest example of this is the USA  which is having a tough time. On the other hand  a communist Cuba is actively helping even other countries fight COVID19! #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,anger

2020-04-11,Hey @RubikaLiyaquat  when was the last time before COVID19 that you discussed public health? India faces an estimated shortage of 160 000 hospital beds. Govt spends only 1.3% of GDP on health. Media is supposed to raise these issues  but you never did. Shame on u #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,sadness
2020-04-11,Mr. @rahulkanwal tum to bade besharam nikle. You are the most slimy propagandist for BJP and its hate politics. India had its first COVID19 positve case on 30th Jan. Will you ever ask the govt what it was doing in Feb and half of March? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,neutral
2020-04-11,The media keeps calling communists anti-national. But how is communist ruled Kerala a model state in dealing with #COVID19. Answer lies not just in emergency relief measures but in its robust health system. Anti-nationals are those who neglect public health. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,anger
2020-04-11,Before the COVID19 stuck  when was the last time you saw the Godi media do a debate on the health system in India? These channels are truly anti-national. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,neutral
2020-04-11,In mid March  while other states prepared for a battle against COVID-19  MP was in political turmoil  as BJP toppled the Congress govt & Shivraj Singh Chouhan became CM for 4th time. Now MP in major crisis  hundreds of COVID19 cases. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,neutral
2020-04-11,It seems that the lockdown is going to be extended. 3 weeks of lockdown & we haven't been able to flatten the curve. One reason for that is that we haven't been testing enough. Along with lockdown  the key to fighting COVID19 remains Test  Test  Test. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,neutral
2020-04-11,Countries  like Germany  with a robust public health system have tackled COVID19 effectively. Even in India  the state of Kerala stands out because of its better public health system  sustained by an overall high govt spending in this sector. Any lessons here? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar,sadness
